## 🧭 Course Overview <a id="overview"></a>

This course introduces essential algorithmic techniques for solving large-scale problems in **integer programming** and **reinforcement learning**. 
It covers modeling, LP relaxation, duality, and exact algorithms such as branch-and-bound and cutting planes, along with decomposition methods like column generation and Benders decomposition. 
On the learning side, the course explores both classical reinforcement learning—such as dynamic programming and temporal-difference methods—and modern approaches including deep RL and recent developments involving large language models (LLMs). 
Through a combination of theory and implementation, students will learn to build, analyze, and apply advanced optimization and learning models to real-world problems.
