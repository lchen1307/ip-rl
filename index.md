## 🧭 Course Overview <a id="overview"></a>

This course explores the intersection of large-scale integer programming and reinforcement learning, two powerful paradigms for modeling and solving complex decision-making problems.

We will cover both classical algorithmic foundations and modern applications, including:
- Dynamic programming, branch-and-bound, and cutting planes
- Deep reinforcement learning methods (e.g., DQN, policy gradients, actor-critic)
- Real-world modeling using MIP + RL (e.g., scheduling, robotics, planning)

**Target audience**: Students interested in optimization, artificial intelligence, and algorithmic decision-making. No prior RL/IP experience required, but mathematical maturity is expected.

## 📚 Syllabus <a id="syllabus"></a>

- Part I: Foundations
  - Introduction to integer programming (IP) and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
  - Classical RL: dynamic programming, temporal-difference learning
  - Policy gradient and actor-critic methods

- Part II: Integration and Applications
  - Combining IP and RL: structured decision models
  - RL with constraints and symbolic structure
  - High-performance solvers and learning-augmented optimization

- Final project (optional): application-oriented modeling with feedback
